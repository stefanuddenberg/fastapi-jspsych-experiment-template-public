            We would now like to tell you a little more about the study.

            Purpose of the Study:
        </h2>
        <p class="text-left my-2">
            This study examines people's mental images of what [[&condition_description]] looks
            like.
            On each screen, you were shown a face and asked to select whether the person looked like
            [[&condition_description]]. These faces were generated by a very particular random
            process
            so that, if we average together all the images you and other people choose, we
            will be able to get a better idea of what all sorts of people believe
            [[&condition_description]] looks
            like â€” perhaps people with different political beliefs, demographics, etc. have
            very different images in their heads! In addition, other participants may have
            been asked to consider what different types of people look like,
            or may have seen different faces to choose from.
        </p>

        <p class="text-left my-2">

            with anyone else who is currently participating or might participate at a future time.
